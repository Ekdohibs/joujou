joujou is a compiler from a small functional language to C.

It supports curried functions, algebraic data types and deep pattern matching,
algebraic effects (with multishot continuations), a static type system with
inference of types and effects, supporting subtyping. It also has a generational
garbage collector included in compiled programs (only the minor generation is
actually collected for now, though).

Its compilation scheme rests on continuation-passing style transformation and
defunctionalisation -- as such, compiled programs are not very efficient. It
however supports efficient application of a n-ary function to all of its
arguments, without building intermediate closures.

Note: see report/report.pdf (in French) for details about the implemented features.
